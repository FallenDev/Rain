Rain has been a program about having a companion in game, that not only acts like a humanoid character. But someone who is capable of playing a character in a hunting situation. 

    How will this be done? Well many see something doing something without your
    interaction as botting. I however, say work smarter not harder. This program
    will be to casters, as a macro keyboard is to bashers. This program will 
    allow you to play a basher type character, while the caster type character
    casts for you. There will be no auto follow, so you will have to pay attention
    and actually control both characters. There will also be no detection systems,
    so if you go afk on the caster. You will be jailed. 

Another use of this program will be to help players with quests. I want to incorporate full quest details in an easy to use and see screen. This will include a mess of images which will have to be pulled from the .dat files. I believe this project is something worth great value to anyone who still loves the game. **- Let's make DA great again! -**

This program is not ment to be fully automated, or for botting purposes. 

This program's ideal setting is for situations where you wish to hunt, but don't have anyone to hunt with.  

There is no ranger detection, nor is there any sort of alerts enabled within the code.

**This is made so that those whom use it, are fully aware that botting is illegal according to TOS.** 

**Although this is not a bot, many will see it as such because of its automation features. Remember that.**

    This program is not supported by Kru nor is is legal within game; neither is Sleephunter, or macro keyboards ...
    ... or multi clients; windowing programs; or any other 3rd party program(s) for that matter.

## Goals and future development objectives
Currently the program is going through a plethora of changes. The original code was lost during a computer refresh. Therefore all 
code will be reconfigured. 

I have obtained various support from a number of members who wish to see me succeed. So I will repurpose code from
actual bots that were within the game.

**Current Bots Being Repurposed For Use:**

    Ditto's Code; Parchment's Code; SecondSpirit's Code; Proxy's Code. Perhaps even some of SleepHunter.

# Next steps
Create WPF base program for which I can pull code into. 

Create a new memory library for which is exclusive to **Rain**.

Pull appropriate code from sources, and sort through the methods and variables.

    -- This will take some time, since there is a lot of nonsense and messy code.
    
Compile code into C# WPF, then sort available libraries which will be needed.

    -- MahApps.Metro ++ a toolkit for creating Metro Style WPF applications
    -- Susanoo ++ a very fast library, giving SQL result mappings
    -- WpfAnimatedGif ++ a library that allows .gif as a background image
    -- zlib.net ++ compression library ((old, might find something else; might also not be needed))
