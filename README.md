Current Version: Working Multi-Client / No logic built in yet. 

**This is made so that those whom use it, are fully aware that botting is illegal according to TOS.** 

**Although this is not a bot, many will see it as such because of its automation features. Remember that.**

    This program is not supported by Kru nor is is legal within game; neither is Sleephunter, or macro keyboards ...
    ... or multi clients; windowing programs; or any other 3rd party program(s) for that matter.

## Goals and future development objectives
Stable release, with working multi-client uploaded. 

Next goals: Getting Program to inject into the client and loopback data. 

# Next steps
**DONE** ~~Create WPF base program for which I can pull code into.~~ 

**NOT IMPLEMENTED** ~~Create a new memory library for which is exclusive to **Rain**.~~

Pull appropriate code from sources, and sort through the methods and variables.

    -- This will take some time, since there is a lot of nonsense and messy code.
    
**DONE** ~~Compile code into C# WPF, then sort available libraries which will be needed.~~

    -- MahApps.Metro ++ a toolkit for creating Metro Style WPF applications
    -- Susanoo ++ a very fast library, giving SQL result mappings
    -- WpfAnimatedGif ++ a library that allows .gif as a background image
    -- zlib.net ++ compression library ((old, might find something else; might also not be needed))
